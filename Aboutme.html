    <h2>Hi, I'm Nidhika</h2>
    <p>Hi, I am Nidhika — a passionate web developer currently pursuing my Bachelor degree in Information Technology. I am in my second year of study, with a strong focus on front-end development and a deep interest in building clean, user-friendly, and functional websites.

I enjoy creating digital experiences that are simple yet impactful. Writing clean code, designing intuitive layouts, and making websites responsive across all devices are things I genuinely love doing. My goal is always to ensure that users have a smooth, enjoyable experience when interacting with anything I build.

With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am continuously exploring modern tools and frameworks like React to enhance my skills and stay updated with industry trends. I also have a growing interest in UI/UX design, which helps me better understand user needs and how to craft interfaces that are both visually appealing and effective.

Beyond academics, I actively engage in self-learning through tutorials, coding challenges, and online communities. Every project I take on, whether for class or personal practice, is an opportunity to learn, grow, and push myself further as a developer.

Looking ahead, I am excited to work on collaborative projects, explore internship opportunities, and contribute to open-source communities. I am committed to becoming a front-end developer who not only builds attractive websites but also delivers meaningful and functional digital experiences.

Let's connect if you are looking for someone creative, driven, and always eager to learn more!
